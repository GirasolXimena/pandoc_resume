## Cover Letter

Hello! I am Ximena Girasol, a design systems and web engineer ready to join Discord in imagining a place! As a user since 2016, I have longed to work at Discord to help build a space for genuine human connection and belonging for everyone. I am beyond hyped to join the team as a software engineer for the design foundations role and believe I am a perfect fit! I am a seasoned and passionate and technical engineer with a playful side ready to bring my expertise in building design systems, web performance, and cross-functional collaboration.

In my current role I am the engineering owner for our design system, Bloom. I led the effort to streamline design-to-development workflows. Implementing a pipeline incorporating:

- design tokens from Figma
- documentation creating a single source of truth (SSOT) on Supernova
- automated design token builds using CSS Custom Properties on GitHub

where it is then consumed by the Bloom and any other teams that need access to our typography, spacing, or color tokens.

I collaborated closely with our design system team and PMs to ensure the process went smoothly. Hosting weekly dev/design sync to track progress and align on naming conventions, expectations, and processes. The project started in January and we now have a stable CI/CD pipeline using Github Actions and over 20 components contributed. Any engineer from across the organization can consume any component as long as they belong to our GitHub organization.
 
My passion for performance is evident in my work. I spearheaded our migration from Webpack to Vite, slashing dev server build times by over 50% and boosting developer satisfaction.  I also championed a data-driven approach to optimization, establishing Core Web Vitals monitoring in Datadog to track ongoing improvement.
 
My integrations with Figma, Supernova, GitHub Actions, and other tools show that I'm highly adaptable when it comes to tooling. Whether integrating established third-party solutions or crafting custom code when needed, I find the right solutions for the job. 

In a previous role at an advertising agency (Riley Hayes) I worked very closely with Account Managers, Copy Writers, and Designers to build marketing pages and web-based marketing pages for national campaigns for brands such as Delta and Best Buy. I have expertise and knowledge in building pixel-perfect pages with a low maintainence overhead that will endure into the future.

Thank you for taking the time to read about why I think no one can name a more iconic duo than Ximena G and Discord! I would love to join an inclusive, passionate, and authentic community to help the place of belonging that is Discord be a little better and more inclusive! Please reach me at X.O.Girasol.Dev@hotmail.com to discuss how great the fit would be because I couldn't fit everything into a cover letter!
